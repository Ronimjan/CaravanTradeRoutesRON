"I want you to use a fixed trade route."
This allows you to pick one of the loaded trade routes your caravan will follow from now on.
There are two preset trade routes, named "Western Trade Route" & "Eastern Trade Route". You can add more on your own by using the template given in the tradeRoutes.xml file.

"I want you to trade without a fixed trade route."
The caravan will now keep on trading as it usually would.
